# Cross-Sectional Equity Factor Research


## Research Objective

The purpose of this project is to study whether information contained in historical stock prices can identify differences in future returns across S&P500 companies.

The project does not attempt to forecast the direction of the complete stock market. It performs cross-sectional research: on every observation date, stocks are compared with other stocks available in the index universe at that time.

The research begins with interpretable price-based factors. Different factor definitions, parameter settings and return horizons are tested across multiple historical periods. Their statistical and economic results are then compared to determine whether any signal is sufficiently stable for further research.

The current objective is factor discovery and evaluation. A production trading strategy or final portfolio construction model is not assumed before the factors demonstrate useful out-of-sample behaviour.

`Data` contains large datasets, calculated matrices and disposable caches. It is excluded from Git because every current file can be downloaded or calculated again.

`Results` contains compact tables, run metadata, audit reports and figures intended for direct reading and Git history.


## Data System [1]

The purpose of this layer is to create the complete data foundation used by the Factor Layer. It downloads the historical S&P500 ticker universe, obtains available Yahoo Finance market data, reconstructs point-in-time index membership and prepares aligned research matrices.

Equity market data are downloaded from 2008. This provides historical observations that can later be used as factor warm-up data. The Data System itself does not select factor-research periods or divide observations into research and validation windows.

The completed layer creates 12 core equity datasets with different metrics and formats:
- Seven **"Processed"** files.
- Five **"Raw"** files.
- One additional macro dataset containing the US three-month Treasury rate.

The final output contains adjusted prices, returns, compatible volume, liquidity, historical index membership, price and volume quality, price availability, long-format prices and 21-day forward returns. All wide matrices use aligned trading dates and historical ticker columns.

Every completed Data System bundle is checked by a separate read-only audit. The audit verifies file readability, matrix alignment, calculated relationships, historical-universe construction, price gaps, volume quality and risk-free-rate coverage. Its results are written to a separate Markdown report and do not automatically change the datasets.


**Limitations**:
- Historical membership is taken from a community-maintained GitHub repository, not from official S&P data.
- yfinance may have missing or incomplete history for delisted stocks and old ticker symbols. Therefore survivorship bias is reduced but not fully removed.
- All Factor Layer results must be interpreted with this remaining survivorship/data-availability bias in mind.
- The dataset ends on the latest repository snapshot instead of assuming an unknown index composition after that date.


IMPORTANT:
- All future features must be computed using data up to t-1
- daily returns represent t-1 -> t
- saved forward returns represent t -> t+21 trading days



### **config.py**:
- Defines separate paths for heavy Data System files in `Data/Data_System` and readable outputs in `Results/Data_System`.
- Stores raw datasets in `Data/Data_System/Raw`, processed matrices in `Data/Data_System/Processed` and the yfinance cache in `Data/Data_System/Cache`.
- Stores the audit report in `Results/Data_System` and audit figures in `Results/Data_System/Figures`.
- Defines the historical S&P500 components URL and the FRED DGS3MO URL.
- `DATA_START_DATE = 2008-01-01`.
- Price-quality parameters:
  - `SUSPICIOUS_ABS_DAILY_RETURN = 0.5`.
  - `MAX_ABS_DAILY_RETURN = 1.0`.
  - `ROUND_TRIP_RETURN_TOLERANCE = 0.25`.
- Audit parameters:
  - `AUDIT_NUMERIC_TOLERANCE = 1e-10`.
  - `AUDIT_FILE_TIME_SPREAD_HOURS = 6`.
  - `AUDIT_VOLUME_JUMP_RATIO = 100`.
- `CONFIRMED_REAL_RETURN_EVENTS` contains manually verified extreme market moves. Currently: `HIG` on `2008-12-05`, `GME` on `2021-01-27` and `NKTR` on `2025-06-24`.
- `YAHOO_REUSED_TICKERS` contains obsolete symbols whose Yahoo history belongs to another security. These symbols are rejected when no verified continuous alias exists.
- `YAHOO_TICKER_ALIASES` contains only verified direct company/ticker changes. Acquisitions, unrelated mergers and post-bankruptcy securities are not treated as continuous aliases.

- No ticker is removed from the historical universe because of missing prices; unavailable ticker-date observations remain unavailable.

**Quality effects**:
- Price quality does not clip valid large returns.
- The saved return matrix contains `92` absolute daily returns of at least 50% and no usable unconfirmed return of at least 100%.
- `33` missing or zero-volume observations during membership are rejected by `volume_quality` and excluded only from liquidity calculations.
- `36` positive-to-positive volume changes of at least 100x remain as warnings because both observations are valid positive values.
- The audit reports `277` missing-price runs longer than 5 trading dates, containing `429,023` observations across `263` tickers.

**Audit result**:
- Overall status: **WARNING**.
- Checks: `54 PASS / 4 WARNING / 0 FAIL`.
- Every required dataset opens successfully.
- All saved wide matrices are aligned and all audited calculated relationships reproduce from their source matrices.
- The risk-free-rate dataset covers the complete equity period.

**Conclusion**:

The Data System produces a structurally consistent point-in-time dataset that is ready to be consumed by the Factor Layer. No failed internal checks remain. The main unresolved limitation is historical price availability from Yahoo Finance: missing and rejected old ticker histories reduce usable membership observations and leave residual survivorship/data-availability bias in all later factor results.




## Factor Layer [2]

The purpose of this layer is to convert the completed market dataset into factor data prepared for cross-sectional research.

The layer calculates the same factor logic for every historical trading date and every available S&P500 member. It does not decide whether a factor works. It only creates the matrices that will be compared with future returns in the Factor Selection Layer.

The completed layer creates:
- `56` factor-score matrices.
- `8` forward-return matrices.
- One factor metadata table.
- One cache manifest.
- One run metadata file.
- One readable Factor Layer report.
- One summary figure for the complete factor grid.

Every matrix contains `4,686` trading dates and `900` historical ticker columns. Observations from 2008 provide warm-up history for long factor windows. The intended research period begins in 2010.


**Limitations**:
- Every factor is based only on prices, returns or volume. Fundamental company information is not used.
- Factor quality is limited by the remaining Yahoo and historical-membership limitations described in the Data System.
- Winsorization is disabled, so unusual but valid factor values remain in the matrices.
- A calculated factor score is not evidence of alpha. Economic and statistical evaluation belongs to the next layer.


IMPORTANT:
- A factor value is calculated on date `t` from information available through date `t`.
- The Factor Layer does not shift the signal by one day.
- The Factor Selection Layer later uses `factor[t-1]` against a forward return beginning on date `t`.
- A factor matrix contains normalized factor scores, not ranks, IC values or predicted returns.
- A forward-return matrix contains realised future returns, not model forecasts.
- Missing source data remain missing in the final matrices.


### **factor_config.py**:
- Defines every Factor Layer data, cache and result path.
- Stores factor matrices in `Data/Factors_Layer/Cache/Factor_Matrices`.
- Stores forward-return matrices in `Data/Factors_Layer/Cache/Forward_Return_Matrices`.
- Stores factor metadata and the cache manifest in `Data/Factors_Layer/Cache`.
- Stores run metadata and the readable report in `Results/Factors_Layer`.
- Stores the Factor Layer summary figure in `Results/Factors_Layer/Figures`.
- Requires at least 80% of observations inside every factor window.
- Keeps winsorization limits at the 1st and 99th cross-sectional percentiles.
- Sets `APPLY_WINSORIZATION = False`, so these limits are not currently applied.
- Uses `252` trading days as the annualization factor.
- Defines eight forward-return horizons: `1`, `5`, `10`, `21`, `42`, `63`, `126` and `252` trading days.
- Defines `56` parameter configurations across `11` factor families.
- Does not contain signal lag, research periods, IC settings or robustness windows. These belong to the Factor Selection Layer.


### **factors.py**:
- Contains the mathematical logic of every factor family.
- Does not contain file paths, parameter grids, saving, ranking, IC calculation or factor selection.
- Receives every window and parameter directly from `factor_builder.py`.


**Momentum**
- Measures cumulative historical return.
- A higher raw value means that the stock rose more strongly during the formation period.
- Can skip the most recent observations before calculating the formation return.
- *Different windows and skipped recent periods are defined in **`factor_config.py`**.*


**Low Volatility**
- Measures the rolling standard deviation of daily returns.
- Lower volatility is preferred, so the result is multiplied by `-1`.
- A higher factor value therefore represents a less volatile stock.


**Trend**
- Calculates `price / moving average - 1`.
- Measures how far the current price is above or below its moving average.
- A positive value means that price is above the moving average.


**Short-Term Reversal**
- Measures recent cumulative return with the opposite sign.
- Recent losers receive higher values and recent winners receive lower values.
- Tests whether short-term price movements tend to reverse.


**Residual Momentum**
- Calculates the equal-weighted return of all available index members on every date.
- Subtracts that market return from every stock return.
- Calculates Momentum from the remaining stock-specific return.
- A higher value means that the stock outperformed the cross-sectional market component.


**Volatility-Scaled Momentum**
- Calculates historical Momentum.
- Divides Momentum by the stock's rolling volatility.
- Rewards strong historical return relative to the amount of price variation used to produce it.
- Replaces zero volatility with missing data before division.


**High Proximity**
- Finds the highest price inside the rolling window.
- Calculates `current price / rolling high - 1`.
- A value closer to zero means that the stock trades closer to its historical high.


**Trend Slope**
- Fits a straight trend line to logarithmic prices inside every rolling window.
- Uses the slope of that line as the factor value.
- Converts the daily slope into an annual rate using `252` trading days.
- Measures the speed and direction of the price trend instead of distance from a moving average.


**Risk-Adjusted Trend**
- Calculates annualized Trend Slope.
- Calculates annualized return volatility over the same window.
- Divides Trend Slope by volatility.
- Rewards a strong trend relative to the instability of daily returns.


**Liquidity Change**
- Calculates daily dollar volume as `price x volume`.
- Compares its short rolling average with its long rolling average.
- Calculates the logarithm of `short average / long average`.
- A positive value means that recent trading activity is higher than its longer-term level.


**Price-Volume Confirmation**
- Starts with normalized Momentum.
- Changes its strength using normalized Liquidity Change.
- Increasing liquidity strengthens Momentum and decreasing liquidity weakens it.
- Limits the liquidity adjustment before combining both signals.



#### _cumulative_log_return
- Converts daily simple returns into logarithmic returns using `log(1 + return)`.
- Shifts returns when the most recent observations must be skipped.

#### winsorize
- Finds the configured lower and upper factor percentiles separately on every date.
- Replaces values outside these boundaries with the boundary values.

#### zscore
- Calculates the cross-sectional mean and standard deviation on every date.
- Subtracts the same-date mean from every available stock value.
- Divides the result by the same-date standard deviation.
- A score of `0` represents the cross-sectional average on that date.
- A score of `1` represents one cross-sectional standard deviation above the average.
- Replaces zero standard deviation with missing data.

## Factor Selection Layer [3]

The purpose of this layer is to identify the shape and strength of the relationship between factor scores and future cross-sectional returns. It combines the 56 Factor Layer configurations with eight return horizons, creating 448 separate hypotheses. It does not recalculate factor formulas and it does not yet build a trading portfolio.

The data foundation is `daily_quantile_results.parquet`. One row represents one trading date and one factor-horizon hypothesis. The complete file contains 2,099,328 rows: 4,686 dates multiplied by 56 factor configurations and eight horizons.

The selection system then converts these daily observations into one readable card per hypothesis. It recognizes positive and negative monotonic relationships, upper-tail effects, lower-tail effects, two-tail effects and cases without stable structure. Positive IC is not required: a stable negative relationship can also be useful when the factor direction is reversed.

The current setting uses `ACTIVE_FACTOR_KEYS = None`. Every run therefore analyzes all 56 factor configurations, all eight horizons, 448 hypotheses and 2,240 separate effect tests.

## Factor Selection Layer Result

![Factor Selection summary](Results/Factor_Selection_Layer/Figures/factor_selection_summary.png)

The complete run analyzes 56 factor configurations across eight horizons. It creates:

- `hypothesis_cards.csv`: one readable classification row per hypothesis.
- `effect_tests.csv`: five separate relationship tests per hypothesis.
- `quantile_curves.csv`: Q1-Q10 factor and return curves.
- `classifier_validation.csv`: the six-case classifier self-check.
- `time_stability.parquet`: monthly and annual effect histories used by the figures.
- `factor_selection_report.md`: the main readable report.
- `factor_selection_summary.png`: the compact scope and final-decision summary used in this README.
- `Figures/`: the complete-scope overview and detailed figures for the active factor.

The completed full run found 426 hypotheses without stable structure and 22 descriptive economic patterns. Ten patterns were unstable through time and twelve were rejected after global multiple-testing correction. No economic hypothesis became a final candidate. One volatility-scaled momentum IC result survived global FDR, but its Q10-Q1 return spread was not statistically supported.

The final Layer 3 conclusion is therefore limited: one configuration is a statistical rank-signal lead, while no configuration is a confirmed economic return effect. Four deliberately labelled leads were frozen for portfolio research instead of silently expanding the search after seeing the results.


## Research Layer [4]

The purpose of this layer is to test whether the frozen Factor Selection leads can be converted into an economically usable portfolio. It does not redefine factor formulas and it does not search the complete 448-hypothesis grid again.

The current shortlist contains four deliberately labelled leads: the globally significant one-day volatility-scaled momentum rank signal and three exploratory return-pattern leads from short-term reversal, liquidity change and low volatility. Passing a lead into this layer does not mean that alpha has already been found.

Layer 4 contains the general research system and one isolated Low Volatility study. The root `pipeline.py` performs the general comparison of the four frozen leads. The `Low_Volatility` folder contains its own configuration, research logic and pipeline for the focused sensitivity study.

Both pipelines compare continuous and tail-based portfolio construction, four rebalance frequencies, calendar starting phases, beta-neutral and unconstrained implementations, four transaction-cost assumptions, full-history risk statistics, two walk-forward structures and point-in-time market regimes.

The walk-forward output is explicitly post-selection. The candidates were already discovered using the complete historical sample, so historical OOS windows cannot become a genuinely untouched final test after the fact. They show temporal behaviour and implementation stability without erasing this limitation.

## Research Layer Interpretation

- Full-history portfolio results are descriptive because the same history influenced the candidate shortlist.
- Global FDR remains the original confirmatory multiple-testing result.
- Within-family and hierarchical corrections show whether the original correction was too broad, but they are not used to rewrite the discovery result.
- Walk-forward analysis measures historical temporal behaviour but cannot recreate a genuinely untouched test after the candidates have already been viewed on the complete history.
- Sector exposure remains explicitly unavailable until a reliable point-in-time sector dataset is added to the Data System.
- A factor is not called alpha unless its return survives costs, turnover, risk exposure, calendar phases, both walk-forward structures and market-regime analysis.
- The focused Low Volatility study looks for a stable parameter plateau, not the single highest Sharpe ratio.


## Research Layer Result

### General Research

![General Research summary](Results/Research_Layer/General/Figures/general_research_summary.png)

The General Research pipeline tested four frozen leads through 160 portfolio implementations. At the declared 10 bps cost assumption:

- Low Volatility became one `ECONOMIC_LEAD`.
- Volatility-Scaled Momentum remained one `STATISTICAL_LEAD`.
- Short-Term Reversal and Liquidity Change were rejected.
- No candidate was labelled validated alpha because candidate discovery already used the complete historical sample.

The selected 60-day Low Volatility implementation produced a 4.77% net annualized return, 0.505 full-history Sharpe and 0.432 long walk-forward Sharpe. Its alpha HAC t-statistic was 1.60, so the result remained an economic lead rather than statistically confirmed alpha.

The complete tables, diagnostics and limitations are saved in `Results/Research_Layer/General/research_report.md`.


### Low Volatility Research

![Low Volatility summary](Results/Research_Layer/Low_Volatility/Figures/low_volatility_summary.png)

The focused pipeline applied the same `Q10 - middle`, beta-neutral, 63-day implementation to seven volatility windows:

- The 60-day window had the highest net annualized return at 4.77% and the highest full-history Sharpe at 0.505.
- It passed 6 of 10 declared checks and remained positive in both walk-forward structures.
- Its neighbouring windows did not form a robust parameter plateau.
- No window survived all statistical, cost, calendar-phase, walk-forward, regime and neighbour-support requirements.

The final status is therefore `ISOLATED_RESULT`, not validated alpha. The complete focused analysis is saved in `Results/Research_Layer/Low_Volatility/low_volatility_report.md`.
